    "text": "Here, we detail our data cleaning and processing methodology. For more details on the raw data, please see this section from the project’s ‘About’ page.\n\n\nWe began by preparing grantee metadata to be used in all subsequent steps. We took as our input a structured list of ERA1 and ERA2 grantees compiled by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC).\nWe also generated geographic crosswalks between grantees and Census geographies, as well as between city-level grantees and county-level grantees.\n\n\n\nThe ERA1 closeout PHPDHF as well as the ERA2 Q4 and reachback PHPDFs had geocoding outputs in a separate file. In this step, we compared the payment files and their corresponding geocodes, and verified that all rows join.\nThe following number of rows were present in the payments file but not in the geocoded file: we geocoded these ourselves, using the Census geocoder.\n\nERA1 closeout: 77 rows (87.03% successfully geocoded)\nERA2 Q4: 24,394 rows (99.95% successfully geocoded)\nERA2 reachback: 0 rows (all rows already geocoded by HUD)\n\nThe other ERA2 PHPDFs already had geocodes appended to the payment data in a single file.\n\n\n\nIn this step, we performed preliminary data-cleaning steps to normalize the formatting of the data. Each PHPDF (one for ERA1 and four for ERA2) was processed independently.\n\nStandardizing variable names\n\nEnsuring compatibility between PHPDF files\n\nStandardizing variable types\n\nTreating GEOIDs as appropriately left-padded strings\nConverting dates to ISO 8601 format\n\nStandardizing NA strings\n\nTurning variously-encoded missing values into proper NAs\n\nDealing with garbled character encodings in source data\nStandardizing grantee identification\n\nCorrecting misspellings and errors\nValidating grantee IDs\n\nRemoving sentinel values (e.g., totals rows)\nCorrecting shifted columns (some grantees submitted data with columns in a different order than required)\nJoining relevant geocode data from geocode file\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we deduplicated each PHPDF independently.\nIn the data, three patterns of duplication were discernible, so we deduplicated in three stages.\n\n\nIdentical payments could be reported by more than one grantee. For the purposes of this stage, ‘identical’ means having the same values across:\n\naddress_line_1\naddress_line_2\naddress_line_3\ncity_name\nstate_code\nzip5\nzip4\npayee_type\ntype_of_assistance\namount_of_payment\ndate_of_payment\nstart_date\nend_date\nprogram\n\nHow such payments were deduplicated depended on the cause of the duplication.\nIf the duplication was due to grantees having overlapping geographies, all records made by the smallest jurisdiction were kept and others dropped (e.g., keep records from the City of Pittsburgh grantee, drop records duplicated in the Allegheny County grantee).\nIf the duplication was due to misattribution of records to grantees with similar names, we dropped the records attributed to the wrong grantee, by inspecting the location of the payments (e.g., records attributed to Cleveland County, OK but were actually made by Cleveland, OH).\n\n\n\nIn a given PHPDF, a grantee could submit data data to Treasury in multiple files. In some cases (very commonly in the ERA1 PHPDF), multiple files with near-identical contents were included from the same grantee. If identical records (using the same definition as above) were included in multiple files from the same grantee, we kept all records from the file with the largest number of records, and dropped duplicated records from all other files of the same grantee.\n\n\n\nRecords could also be duplicated within a given file from a given grantee. Here, we define identical records more conservatively, since missing data across the identifying columns mean that multiple distinct payments could look the same if they are all missing critical elements like street address. Therefore, if any of the following variables were NA, we gave each NA value a temporary unique value to avoid using these missing values in identifying duplication.\n\naddress_line_1\npayee_type\ntype_of_assistance\namount_of_payment\ndate_of_payment\nstart_date\n\nWithin a given file from a given grantee, we keep the duplicate record with the lowest row number and drop all others.\n\n\n\nWe report the following figures to illustrate the extent of de/duplication in each PHPDF:\n\nERA1 closeout: 5,621,334 rows dropped (42%)\n\nThe large percentage here is due to many grantees submitting duplicated files with the same contents to Treasury\n\nERA2 Q4: 54,293 rows dropped (0.9%)\nERA2 Q2: 12,261 rows dropped (0.3%)\nERA2 Q1: 98,317 rows dropped (2%)\nERA2 reachback: 74 rows dropped (~0%)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we imputed county locations for payments that were missing a geocoded county. This step was necessary for 54,831 rows of payment data where the county geo-identifier was missing.\nFor each program, we used two methods:\n\n\nFor county-level grantees and city-level grantees whose jurisdictions are included in only one geographic county, we imputed as the county of payment the geographic county of the grantee’s jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nFor state programs, this was a bit more complicated. We utilized a ZIP code-county crosswalk from HUD.\nFirst, we determined which zip codes in the crosswalk fell into just one county. Similarly to above, we then joined the single-county zips to the payment files, but this time, by zip code and state. We found that joining by city was too limiting, as the cities were described differently in each file (for example, the same address could be described as being in Las Vegas or North Las Vegas).\nThe next, slightly more complicated step, was to join zip codes that fell within multiple counties. To be able to join one-to-one, we filtered the HUD county-zip crosswalk file to include counties where 95% of a zip code was within the county. After that, we could simply join by zip code and state.\n\n\n\nWe then coalesced from geocode_county_geoid and imputed_county_geoid. If a payment already had a value for geocode_county_geoid, then we kept that value. If not, it took on the value of imputed_county_geoid. At the beginning, 54,831 rows were missing geocode_county_geoid. After imputation, 25,604 rows were missing county_geoid_coalesced. These rows are subsequently dropped (in step 7). Therefore, we imputed values for counties for 29,227 payments. In all subsequent data processing steps, we use this coalesced county assignment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we generated data validation metrics for each PHPDF.\nWe first generated a series of variable-specific data quality checks, testing each row for:\n\nWhether the record was within the geographic jurisdiction of the grantee\nWhether the record was locatable to a specific county\nWhether the payment amount was recorded, and if so, whether it was negative, zero, or anomalously large\n\nWe defined ‘anomalously large’ as an amount exceeding the 99.9th percentile value of all records in ERA1 closeout and ERA2 Q4 ($73,541).\n\nWhether the date of payment was recorded, and if so, whether it was impossibly early (before January, 1, 2021 for ERA1, or before March 1, 2021 for ERA2) or late (after December 31, 2022 for ERA1, or after the end of the reporting quarter for ERA2)\nWhether the payee type (landlord, utility, tenant) was recorded\nWhether the assistance type (rent, utilities, other) was recorded\nWhether the record included a valid address\nThe geocoding quality of the record, as given by HUD’s geocoding process\n\nFor each aggregation type, we selected a subset of these variable quality tests to calculate grantee-level variable quality.\n\nFor the county-month dataset, we employed the first 4 tests\nFor the county-total dataset we imposed the first 3 tests\n\nFor each grantee, we calculated the percentage of its records that met all applicable variable quality tests for the relevant aggregation scenario.\nFor each grantee, we also calculated the percentage of its aggregate spending in the PHPDF compared to:\n\nIts total allocation for the applicable program (ERA1 or 2)\nThe amount reported in Treasury’s publicly released aggregate summary reporting, which was itself compiled from aggregate reporting submitted by grantees to Treasury\nThe amounts in the above bullet, but calculated at the state level (i.e., PHPDF spending added together for all grantees in a state, divided by aggregate reporting together for all grantees in a state)\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we specified acceptable data quality thresholds for all grantees.\nFirst, for each PHPDF, we calculated whether each grantee met the following thresholds:\n\nVariable quality: At least 79% of records had acceptable data across all variables needed for the applicable aggregation type (see Step 5 above for details on the tests)\nSpending completeness: The aggregate sum of the grantee’s payments (excluding negative payments) were:\n\nBetween 80% and 110% of its allocation (ERA1) or 50% and 110% of its allocation (ERA2); or\nIf between 50% and 80% of its allocation (ERA1) or 25% and 50% of its allocation (ERA2), the reported spending was within 20% of the aggregate spending as reported to Treasury, either individually or for all grantees in the state together\n\n\nSecond, we picked an ERA2 PHPDF source for each grantee, taking the most recent PHPDF for which a grantee passed (if any quarters passed) or the most recent PHPDF we had data for the grantee (if all quarters failed).\nThird, for any grantees which participated in either program (n = 405), we joined the diagnostic data for ERA1 and ERA2 to derive overall threshold checks. A grantee passed if it:\n\nSubmitted data for all programs it participated in\nPassed the variable quality threshold for all programs it participated in\nPassed the spending completeness threshold for all programs it participated in\n\nFourth, we applied a geographic threshold: if an otherwise passing grantee significantly overlapped in the area of its jurisdiction with a failing grantee, then it failed this threshold. This was done because, in geographic areas served by multiple grantees, missing or bad-quality data from one grantee may have impacted a significant percentage of ERA activity in that geographic area overall.\nWe defined ‘significantly overlap’ as: more than 20% of the population of the geographic area served by the passing grantee being located in the overlap(s) with the geographic area(s) served by non-passing grantee(s). This was always taken to be the case for county and city grantees vis-à-vis their state grantees.\nFlowcharts illustrating these thresholding steps and the number of grantees dropped at each juncture are available below.\n\n\n\nFlowchart illustrating number of grantees affected by each thresholding step, for the county-total aggregation\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart illustrating number of grantees affected by each thresholding step, for the county-month aggregation\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we prepared the final data to be aggregated.\nFirst, we bound the ERA1 data together with the ERA2 data. We selected the vintage of the ERA2 data by each grantee, as specified in Step 6.\nSecond, we identified geographic counties with coverage issues due to incomplete grantee coverage. For example, if the Cook County, IL, grantee failed, any payments that the State of Illinois grantee made in Cook County should also drop. Note that this screening of counties at the geographic level was in addition to the screening of counties/cities at the grantee level in Step 6.\nThird, we filtered the joined data to only include the records to be included in the final aggregation. Namely, we only kept records where:\n\nThe grantee passed all Step 6 thresholds\nThe record was assigned to a county\nThe county did not fall out due to the geographic screening described above\nThe record passed all variable-level checks necessary for the applicable aggregation type\n\nFourth, we constructed unique address IDs. To do this, we first extracted unit number information from the following fields, in order of availability:\n\nGeocoded address unit number\nAddress line 2/3\nAddress line 1\n\nWe then assigned a unique ID to each unique concatenated value of:\n\ngeocoded address\n\nif geocoded address was missing, we used the original address if available\nif there was no address at all, we used the record’s row number\n\nunit number\ngeocoded ZIP code\ngeocoded state\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we performed the final aggregation.\nTaking the data output from the previous step, we grouped the data by variables identifying each cell in the final output (e.g., county GEOID and payment month for the county + month aggregation), then calculated two quantities for each cell:\n\nThe sum of payment amounts\nThe number of unique assisted addresses\n\nWe then suppressed cell values where the number of unique assisted addresses is less than 11, and the corresponding payment amount sum. The suppressed values are encoded with the value -99999."

    "title": "County Emergency Rental Assistance Spending: An Introduction to the Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program was administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on renter households.\nA total of $46.55 billion was distributed to state, territorial, county, city, and tribal governments through two programs: ERA1 ($25.55 billion authorized in December 2020 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021) and ERA2 ($21 billion included with the American Rescue Plan Act, passed March 2021). States, Washington, D.C., and territories were entitled to be ERA grantees. County and city governments were eligible to be ERA grantees if they met population requirements. Though Treasury set overall guidelines for the administration of the program, each grantee established its own mechanisms for the processing of applications and payments. Similarly, though Treasury published uniform data reporting requirements, each grantee had its own mechanisms for data collection and management.\nOver the course of the two programs, ERA funds could be used to address various housing needs for low-income renters. For the purposes of this project we focus on assistance paid by grantees to address rent (forward and in arrears), utility costs (forward and in arrears), and ‘other housing-related expenses’ as defined by Treasury (such as relocation expenses). Assistance could be paid either to tenants, landlords, utility companies, or providers of housing-related expenses. Further details on eligibility requirements and programmatic guidance for ERA can be found on Treasury’s web site for ERA.\nThis dataset details aggregate ERA spending at the county-month level and the county-total level. We attempted to establish broad coverage across the nation, aiming to share these data publicly with researchers interested in applying ERA payments data to their own research.\nThis project was completed by a team comprising of the Housing Initiative at Penn, the Eviction Lab (Princeton University), and Urban Deplacement Project (University of California, Berkeley), partially in fulfillment of an award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The project was also supported by grant R01NR020854 (MPI Eisenberg and Pollack). Hepburn’s involvement is supported by R01NR020748.\nThe project team is solely responsible for the analytical decisions made in this project and the accuracy of aggregated files produced by this project. This work does not reflect the views of the U.S. Government or any other funding sources.\n\n\nThe aggregate data produced by this project may be cited as:\nKim, Chi-Hyun, Grace Hartley, Jacob Haas, Tim Thomas, Rebecca Yae, and Peter Hepburn. County Emergency Rental Assistance Spending. 2025. Accessed via TKTK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main sources of data for this project were confidential ERA payment data reported to the U.S. Department of the Treasury by ERA grantees. ERA grantees were required to submit periodic, detailed reports to Treasury on the payments they had made for assistance to households. (However, Tribal grantees were exempt from the reporting payment-level data, and their payments are not reflected in this dataset. There were 301 Tribal grantees, with $841,390,378 in total allocations.) The reports to Treasury were intended to offer payment-by-payment details on how ERA funds were distributed, including: amounts and dates of payments, addresses of the assisted property, type of payment (e.g., rent arrearage), and type of payee (e.g., landlord). These reports were compiled by Treasury into large files called Participant Household Payment Data Files (PHPDFs), separately for ERA1 and ERA2. The project team received these data between August 2023 and May 2024.\nFor ERA1, Treasury compiled a closeout PHPDF based on the payments reported by grantees for the entirety of the ERA1 period of performance ending on December 29, 2022. This forms the basis of the ERA1 payments data used in this analysis.\nFor ERA2, the program was still within its period of performance through 2023.

    "text": "The Federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program was administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on renter households.\nA total of $46.55 billion was distributed to state, territorial, county, city, and tribal governments through two programs: ERA1 ($25.55 billion authorized in December 2020 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021) and ERA2 ($21 billion included with the American Rescue Plan Act, passed March 2021). States, Washington, D.C., and territories were entitled to be ERA grantees. County and city governments were eligible to be ERA grantees if they met population requirements. Though Treasury set overall guidelines for the administration of the program, each grantee established its own mechanisms for the processing of applications and payments. Similarly, though Treasury published uniform data reporting requirements, each grantee had its own mechanisms for data collection and management.\nOver the course of the two programs, ERA funds could be used to address various housing needs for low-income renters. For the purposes of this project we focus on assistance paid by grantees to address rent (forward and in arrears), utility costs (forward and in arrears), and ‘other housing-related expenses’ as defined by Treasury (such as relocation expenses). Assistance could be paid either to tenants, landlords, utility companies, or providers of housing-related expenses. Further details on eligibility requirements and programmatic guidance for ERA can be found on Treasury’s web site for ERA.\nThis dataset details aggregate ERA spending at the county-month level and the county-total level. We attempted to establish broad coverage across the nation, aiming to share these data publicly with researchers interested in applying ERA payments data to their own research.\nThis project was completed by a team comprising of the Housing Initiative at Penn, the Eviction Lab (Princeton University), and Urban Deplacement Project (University of California, Berkeley), partially in fulfillment of an award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The project was also supported by grant R01NR020854 (MPI Eisenberg and Pollack). Hepburn’s involvement is supported by R01NR020748.\nThe project team is solely responsible for the analytical decisions made in this project and the accuracy of aggregated files produced by this project. This work does not reflect the views of the U.S. Government or any other funding sources.\n\n\nThe aggregate data produced by this project may be cited as:\nKim, Chi-Hyun, Grace Hartley, Jacob Haas, Tim Thomas, Rebecca Yae, and Peter Hepburn.

    "text": "The main sources of data for this project were confidential ERA payment data reported to the U.S. Department of the Treasury by ERA grantees. ERA grantees were required to submit periodic, detailed reports to Treasury on the payments they had made for assistance to households. (However, Tribal grantees were exempt from the reporting payment-level data, and their payments are not reflected in this dataset. There were 301 Tribal grantees, with $841,390,378 in total allocations.) The reports to Treasury were intended to offer payment-by-payment details on how ERA funds were distributed, including: amounts and dates of payments, addresses of the assisted property, type of payment (e.g., rent arrearage), and type of payee (e.g., landlord). These reports were compiled by Treasury into large files called Participant Household Payment Data Files (PHPDFs), separately for ERA1 and ERA2. The project team received these data between August 2023 and May 2024.\nFor ERA1, Treasury compiled a closeout PHPDF based on the payments reported by grantees for the entirety of the ERA1 period of performance ending on December 29, 2022. This forms the basis of the ERA1 payments data used in this analysis.\nFor ERA2, the program was still within its period of performance through 2023. Grantees were required to submit data on a quarterly basis, reporting cumulative payments made from the beginning of ERA2 up to the end of the reporting period. We generally use the PHPDF for the 2023 Q4 reporting period, but supplement with data reported in earlier quarters in 2023 for grantees with good data quality in those files but with bad-quality or missing data in the Q4 file.\nWhether the ultimate source of the assistance was ERA1 or ERA2 was largely immaterial for tenants and landlords, so our final aggregation does not distinguish between them.

    "text": "We provide two different aggregations:\n\nCounty-total aggregation: This represents the total amount of spending for assistance to households in a county (or county-equivalent), without regard to the date of payment (but excluding any payments known to be made after March 31, 2023). There is one observation per county.\nCounty-month aggregation: This represents the total monthly spending for assistance to households in a county (or county-equivalent) for each month from January 2021 through March 2023. Thus, there are multiple observations per county.\n\nTwo quantities are calculated for each observation:\n\nThe sum of the dollar amount paid for assistance, and\nThe number of unique addresses assisted.\n\nBoth these quantities are aggregated without regard to assistance type or payee type (e.g., landlord, tenant). Small values (fewer than 11 unique addresses per observation and the corresponding dollar amount for that observation) are suppressed.\nThe data between the two aggregations are not directly comparable, for the following reasons:\n\nSome grantees submitted data with missing or poor-quality payment dates; these grantees’ payments could not be included in the county-month aggregation but could be included in the county-total aggregation.

Suppressed with value -99999 if value was less than 11.\n\n\n\n\nThe PHPDF data were compiled by Treasury from hundreds of independent submissions made by ERA grantees to Treasury. In total, 400 state and local ERA1 grantees and 373 state and local ERA2 grantees accepted allocations for ERA. Compliance with Treasury’s reporting requirements was not universal; some grantees failed to report data altogether, while some records which were submitted to Treasury were nonconformant with Treasury’s published data standards. Therefore, users should be aware that this dataset does not represent complete coverage of ERA spending across the nation.\nWe highlight the following data limitations:\n\nMany grantees who participated in ERA are not represented in the data due to data missingness or quality issues. The county-month dataset reflects reports from 183 grantees (45% of grantees). The county-total dataset reflects reports from 192 grantees (47% of grantees). The drop-off is due to data non-submission (15% of grantees), poor-quality data (6% for county-month, 3% for county-total), spending amounts inconsistent with allocation amounts (13%), and geographic overlap with grantees that did not pass the preceding thresholds (21%).\nMissing grantees may affect entire geographies even if other grantees serving that geography have good data quality; for example, if a state grantee is missing, every county in that state will be missing. The county-month dataset provides coverage across 2,218 county-equivalents (71% of county-equivalents, 61% of U.S. renter population), while the county-total offers coverage in 2,274 county-equivalents (72% of county-equivalents, 63% of U.S. renter population).\nNot every payment made by a grantee may have been reported by the grantee. Particularly for ERA2, grantees were required to submit cumulative data up to the reporting period, but not all may have done so. We threshold the data to drop grantees unlikely to be reporting full data, but this may not have screened out every such grantee.\nGrantees may have reported addresses for the payee (landlord or utility), even though they were required to report addresses for the assisted property. We excluded payments made outside of the geographic jurisdiction of the grantee, since these payments by definition do not record the address of the assisted household, but this may not have filtered out all misreported addresses.\nUp to 20% of a grantee’s records may be dropped due to data quality issues (for example, missing payment amounts), while still passing our data quality thresholds.\nThe months in the county-month aggregation refer to dates of payment, not dates of assistance. Payments could address both arrears and forward rent, so payment dates should not be conflated with dates over which households were assisted.\nGrantees differed in how they structured their payments. Some may have made a separate payment for each month of assistance, while others may have made one payment for the entire duration of assistance. Therefore, an address which received 3 months of forward rent could show up across 3 months if the grantee made 3 separate payments, or across one month if the grantee made 1 payment for all three months.\nCounties containing a large share of missing-address records may have an inflated count of unique assisted addresses. This was because records which could be located to a county but did not include address information were treated as unique for the purpose of counting unique addresses. Users should consult the data coverage tables included below for a list of these counties.\nPayments made by Tribal grantees are not included, because they did not submit data for PHPDFs.\nDollar amounts reported are nominal values and are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nFor more information on which grantees and records are included in the aggregation, please refer to the data coverage descriptives provided here (for the county-total aggregation) and here (for the county-month aggregation).\n\n\n\nThe aggregation files may be found as CSV’s at this project’s public Github repository, here.\nPotential users of these data are highly encouraged to review the list of limitations above and to inspect the data coverage descriptives in light of their particular needs."
